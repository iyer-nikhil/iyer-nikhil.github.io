Welcome to my personal website dedicated to informative guides and exploratory posts that I wrote for fun!

I received my B.S. in Mathematics & Actuarial Science from the University at Albany with a minor in Computer Science. 
After passing two actuarial exams (P/1 and FM/2) I decided to shift gears, exploring how I could better mesh my mathematical prowess
with my passion for technology in a professional setting. 

After working as a production assistant and data analyst, I enrolled in a professional development course for data science
to kickstart my learning into high gear and make the leap. During and after the program, I took on a few freelancing projects 
to build my skills and accelerate my learning. 

While I'm not writing a webscraper or preprocessing my way through gigabytes of data, you can find me watching Netflix
series and whipping up a new meal from a recipe I just found. I enjoy taking walks around New York City, and frequent the public
golf courses around Long Island when I have the time.  

Thanks for visiting and please make sure to check out all my projects so far! Stay tuned for more to come and feel free to use the
