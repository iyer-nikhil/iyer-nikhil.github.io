I have always had a passion for information technology and programming from a very young age. At 14, I learned C++ but
did not really use it effectively as more than what I was taught. In college, I had the priviledge of learning from 
experienced teachers at Carnegie Mellon University through their intro and intermediate level java classes. But after
taking data structures, I thought I wasn't cut out for high level programming. 

So I took a break, focusing instead on my statistical and mathematical probability knowledge and building it to form.
Graduating from SUNY Albany with a B.S. in Mathematical & Actuarial Sciences, my true passions were put to the test
in actuarial examinations. They took all I had, but after passing the P/1 and FM/2, I decided to take a slightly different
route. 

The summer of 2017, I enrolled in the Metis program, a 12-week course designed to teach the data science stack for
big data and modern analysis. It was fascinating to learn how effective python could be as a tool and how well maintained
many of the packages were. Also, learning was intuitive, and brought about many 'Aha!' moments as I created projects
designed to implement every aspect of what I learned.

Now, looking to further my expertise and turn practice into production, I'm currently looking for data science and data
engineering opportunities. I hope by the start of 2018, I will have more projects, posts, and knowledge to bring to the
data science community!
