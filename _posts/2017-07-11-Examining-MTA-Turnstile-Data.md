NYC Open Data puts out a lot of neat information online. One of these pieces is MTA data that shows how many people go through various turnstiles across NYC's boroughs. I thought it was a cool EDA to check out and especially the subway line that is relatively new to the city and one close to my heart: the 2nd Ave Q line.

This line is relatively new, only open as of January 1st, 2017 for parts that go through 72nd and 96th street. After loving this area so much, having friends who live in this area as well, I thought it would be cool to check out exactly how many people go in and out of this area.

As you can see from the image below, it is relatively consistent goings for turnstiles for different days of the week:
