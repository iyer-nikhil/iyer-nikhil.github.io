Welcome to my personal website dedicated to informative guides and exploratory posts that I wrote for fun!

While I'm not writing a webscraper or parsing through gigabytes of data, you can find me lounging around the
house, watching Netflix episodes of whatever is trending or whipping up a new meal from a recipe I just found. I
enjoy taking walks around New York City, visiting Central Park, as checking out the latest food craze to hit the
streets (you can tell by now I'm a foodie!). 

I grew up in Long Island so sometimes I make the trip back to hang with the parents and old high school friends.
You can also guarantee on warm sunny days that I'm golfing at Bethpage State Park. If you want to check out my 
instagram, devoted to my secret double life as a golfer, follow me [@toomuchgolf](https://www.instagram.com/toomuchgolf).

Thanks for visiting! Stay tuned for more to come and feel free to use the form below to send a message anytime with
your questions and comments!
