Welcome to my webpage dedicated to personal projects. Prior to joining Metis to pursue my
data mining skills, I graduated from the State University of New York at Albany with a B.S. in
Actuarial and Mathematical Sciences and passed the P/1 and FM/2 actuary exams. After graduation, I
wanted to broaden my data analysis skills and worked for numberFire, one of the premiere 
daily fantasy sports resources on the web, and ProHEALTH Care, one of the nation's largest health
provider management organizations. Recently I've seen the huge potential open-source tools Python
had compared to most paid data analysis tools.
