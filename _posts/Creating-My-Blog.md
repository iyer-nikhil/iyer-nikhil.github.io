Everyone wants to have a personal website, you can display your infomation to public. Fortunately, its pretty easy
with Jekyll and github pages. I designed this website by taking a previous website design that I liked, used some elements of it
but changed most of it through trial & error + testing.

Most of the configurations of websites exist in the config.yml page of Jekyll, but this particular project was all over the place and definitely required
a lot more than that. But a couple of pointers for those trying their skills at making a website:

1. Use finder to find various instances of words scattered throughout the css, including the names of pictures and fonts. This will help you locate exactly where you need to edit style changes in order to push it to your website

2. Push changes to your github repository and view your website, done!
