<p>NYC Open Data puts out a lot of neat information online. One of these pieces is MTA data that shows how many people go through various turnstiles across NYC’s boroughs. I thought it was a cool EDA to check out and especially the subway line that is relatively new to the city and one close to my heart: the 2nd Ave Q line.</p>

<p>This line is relatively new, only open as of January 1st, 2017 for parts that go through 72nd and 96th street. After loving this area so much, having friends who live in this area as well, I thought it would be cool to check out exactly how many people go in and out of this area.</p>

<p>As you can see from the image below, it is relatively consistent goings for turnstiles for different days of the week:</p>

<p>As you can see from these 4 weeks of data that I obtained, they follow a similar pattern, with ridership relatively slow on mondays, picking up through midweek, and dropping off by the weekend. It is fascinating to see that for some weeks, there is a jump from Saturday into Sunday but for some weeks, there is a dip. This might be due to attractions or certain weekend events that restaurants have in the area. I’d also like to see how street fairs in the area could potentially impact this graph.</p>

<p>Here is another visual in the form of a bar graph to give you a much better side by side comparison of days in different weeks:</p>

<p>One interesting thing to note is that these are just entries into the subway and not exits. Why did I choose to leave exits alone? well its because of something I noticed when exploring the overall dataset for multiple stations.</p>

<p><!-- ![edit](/3steps/img1g4.jpg) -->
   <img src="/3steps/img1g4.jpg" width="70%" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>When looking at the chart above, you notice consistently that the entries are nowhere near the population of people exiting the station. But people have to enter and exit at the same time the subway cars can’t just be eating people! <br />
Thats because in some cases, people use the emergency exits on the turnstiles, which do not count the number of people. So having the entries is for the most part accurate because that barrier is set. Using exits would not be doing the data justice.</p>

<p>The one failure of this is I used this data to initially explore what stations to target if we were to advertise and give people fliers on their way OUT of the station. I wouldn’t be using the most accurate data as exits would be the thing to target here but we cannot know for sure if that information is even accurate.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening to my intro EDA for MTA Turnstiles. I hope to have more for you soon!</p>
